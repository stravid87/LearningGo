The main difference between digital signatures and encryption lies in their
purpose and functionality: 
Purpose: 
    Digital Signature: 
        A digital signature is used to verify the authenticity and integrity of a message or document. It
        provides a way to ensure that the message or document has not been tampered with
        and that it was indeed sent by the claimed sender. 
    Encryption: 
        Encryption is used to protect the confidentiality of a message or data. It transforms the
        original message into an unreadable form, known as ciphertext, using an
        encryption algorithm. Only authorized parties with the corresponding decryption
        key can decrypt and read the original message. 

Functionality: 
    Digital Signature:
        A digital signature is created by applying a cryptographic hash function to the
        message or document and then encrypting the hash value with the sender's private
        key. The resulting signature can be decrypted using the sender's public key to
        verify the integrity and authenticity of the message. 
    Encryption: 
        Encryption involves transforming the original message using an encryption algorithm and a
        secret encryption key. The encrypted message, or ciphertext, can only be
        decrypted using the corresponding decryption key, which is typically kept secret
        by the intended recipient.

Key Usage: 
    Digital Signature: 
        Digital signatures use asymmetric key cryptography, where the sender has a private key for signing and
        the recipient has a corresponding public key for verification. The private key
        is kept secret by the sender, while the public key is shared with others.
    Encryption: 
        Encryption can use either symmetric or asymmetric key cryptography.
        Symmetric encryption uses the same key for both encryption and decryption, while
        asymmetric encryption uses a pair of keys: a public key for encryption and a
        private key for decryption. 

In summary, digital signatures are used for
verifying the authenticity and integrity of a message, while encryption is used
to protect the confidentiality of a message. Digital signatures use asymmetric
key cryptography, while encryption can use either symmetric or asymmetric key
cryptography. 
It's important to note that digital signatures and encryption are
often used together in secure communication systems to provide both
confidentiality and integrity.
