About Authentication and Authorization
https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/authentication-vs-authorization/

Authentication
    Determines who you are
    Verifies that no-one is impersonating you
    three ways to authenticate
        who you are (biometrics)
        what you have (eg, atm card; key; phone...)
        what you know (username; password, ...)
    two-factor authentication

Authorization
    Says what you are allowed to do
    The name of the http header used for authentication


Http Basic Authentication
    Basic authentication part of the specification of http
        send username / password with every request
        uses authorization header & keyword "basic"
            put "username:password" together
            converts them to base64
                puts generic binary data into printable
                base64 is reversible
                    never use with http; only https
                use basic authentication to login
